\section{Summary}
\label{impl:summary}

Implementation characteristics of the prototype load balancing service were the
main topic of this chapter.
The kernel provides per thread accounting on a set of predetermined hardware
performance counters and defines an interface to access a thread's account from
user land.

These measurements are the main information source for the load balancer.
The other information source is the static task configuration defining
isolation and communication groups.
The system designer provides these information via the task startup script to
the load balancer.

This chapter finished with a discussion about different algorithms for the
\gls{smt} abstraction, group placement, and balancing in space and time.
Also, I presented a simple load distribution algorithm to provide a baseline for
evaluation.
\\

The next chapter evaluates the prototype's performance by comparing it to the
simple load distribution algorithm and Linux's \gls{cfs}.
