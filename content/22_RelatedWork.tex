\section{Related Work}
\label{state:related}

This section presents prior work and puts emphasis on the parts pertinent to
this thesis.
One assumption for this work is already in place:
the target architecture is a single ISA, partly symmetric homogeneous
multicore.
Partly symmetric means the target architecture supports \gls{smt},
but besides this, it is a \gls{smp} architecture.
Hence, research proposing hardware changes, e.g. \cite{cruz_dynamic_2014},
is out of scope.
Also research focusing on heterogeneous or multi-ISA architectures, e.g.
\cite{sarma_smartbalance_2015}, is not part of the review.

%One restriction applies to this review: mechanism proposing hardware changes
%are not in the focus of this work.
%This restriction excludes interesting ideas to gather behavioural information,
%e.g. observation of cache coherency traffic proposed in
%\cite{cruz_dynamic_2014}.


In literature, different approaches to load balancing on a multicore have been
explored.
\citeauthor{snavely_symbiotic_2000} introduced the term \emph{symbiotic
scheduling} in \cite{snavely_symbiotic_2000}, describing a scheduling technique
for \gls{smt}-systems.
They propose scheduling those two jobs on a shared core, which provide the best
utilization of said core.
The combination of two jobs on two corresponding \gls{smt}-cores call they a
co-schedule.
The performance of a co-schedule is defined as the turnaround or response time:
the time between the arrival of a job in the ready queue and its completion.

In their experiments they run independent jobs on a simulator modeling a Compaq
Alpha 21264 out-of-order processor with hardware additions for multi-threading.
This simulator model includes performance counters to ``capture dynamic execution
information''(\autocite[236]{snavely_symbiotic_2000}).
To determine a good schedule the authors compute the weighted speedup \textit{WS} for
a fixed time interval.
For each job the change in instructions per cycle (IPC) compared to
single-threaded execution is calculated.
The sum of these values for all jobs is the weighted speedup of this
schedule.
$$ WS(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n (\text{realized IPC job}_i / \text{single-threaded IPC
job}_i)$$
Their developed scheduler consists of two phases: sampling and symbiosis.
During the sampling phase different job combinations are measured.
When enough samples are gathered, the scheduler moves to the symbiosis phase
and uses schedules, which promise the highest weighted speedup.
The scheduler will move back and forth between these phases, as the job-mix
changes.

The measurements of the performance counters are used to create several
predictors for the behaviour of jobs in the future and, hence, the best schedule.
The best predictor in their study made a majority vote of all other predictors
to determine the best schedule.
\citeauthor{snavely_symbiotic_2000} conclude, that good job symbiosis depends
not only on high IPC, but on a multitude of other factors, too, e.g. usage
conflicts in shared hardware resources or cache hit rates.
\\


In \citeyear{snavely_symbiotic_2002} \citeauthor{snavely_symbiotic_2002}
discussed the topic of priorities in symbiotic schedules.
In their earlier work (\cite{snavely_symbiotic_2000}) they assumed same
priority jobs.
Now, they present two meanings for priority: ``(A) guarantee a fraction of
machine proportional to priority'' or ``(B) guarantee a fraction of
single-threaded performance proportional to priority''
(\autocite[70]{snavely_symbiotic_2002}).
The authors base their priority mechanisms on two values: SOLOFRAC and CS.
SOLOFRAC is the, from the priority derived fraction of the CPU time,
a job needs to be scheduled alone and CS is the fraction of the CPU time,
where no job is solo scheduled.

The 'Naive' priority mechanism schedules a job alone for its SOLOFRAC
share and co-schedules for CS cycles. Behind this stand two assumptions: first,
during co-scheduling each job is an equal share of the cycles assigned.
And second, the number of jobs does not exceed the number of \gls{smt}-cores.

The proposed 'Symb' mechanism on the other hand, can handle more jobs
than available \gls{smt}-cores and observes job behaviour. By running jobs
solo, 'Symb' determines the job's ``'natural' IPC''
(\autocite[71]{snavely_symbiotic_2002})
and then evaluates the job's performance during a phase of co-scheduling.
Based on this measurement, the SOLOFRAC portion is reduced such that the job get its
rightful share of cycles. The increase in co-scheduling time leads to increased
utilization of the system.

Other presented approaches in \cite{snavely_symbiotic_2002} require hardware
changes and are therefore out of scope.
\\

While \citeauthor{snavely_symbiotic_2000} claim in
\cite{snavely_symbiotic_2000} a reduction in average turnaround time by up to
17\%, \citeauthor{eyerman_revisiting_2015} state a mere 3\% to 6\% increase in
average throughput with an optimal symbiotic scheduler compared to a
first-come-first-serve scheduler.
The notable difference explain the authors in \cite{eyerman_revisiting_2015} as
different experimental views. \citeauthor{snavely_symbiotic_2000} study a fully
loaded system with twice as much ready jobs as SMT-cores and observe the
turnaround time.
The turnaround time of a job is mainly influenced by the time it waits in the
ready queue, when all cores are loaded.
If the maximum throughput increases slightly, the waiting time is reduced,
hence, a significant reduction in turnaround time is observed.
Also, a job reordering in a shortest remaining time first manner, can also
reduce the average turnaround time.
For these reasons \citeauthor{eyerman_revisiting_2015} make the case,
that turnaround time alone can be a misleading measure.

Furthermore, maximum throughput cannot be used, because systems are not
designed to run at peak load all the time, as this leads to long queues and
turnaround times.
Average throughput equals average load if the system is not fully loaded,
therefore, it is a useless comparator.
Instead, they advocate to evaluate processor utilization (understood as average
number of executing cores) and empty periods.
If throughput is improved, the processor utilization decreases and empty
periods are enlarged, as the time to execute the current load is reduced.
Hence, using these two measures scheduler caused improvements can be compared.

\citeauthor{eyerman_revisiting_2015} conclude that one should not expect large
improvements through symbiotic scheduling, but particular workloads may benefit.
Furthermore, previous studies on partially symmetric mutlicores showed
notable throughput gains by symbiotically co-scheduling applications on
SMT-packages.
\todo{which particular workloads? Which previous studies? What's
a notable gain?}
\\

Measuring the performance of a specific schedule in a \gls{smt}-system is
difficult, especially, if no off-line knowledge is used. But even then,
pinpointing the performance gain to the scheduling decision and is only
manageable with fine granular observation of the system.
However, \cite{snavely_symbiotic_2000} and \cite{eyerman_revisiting_2015}
showed the relevance of a symbiotic co-schedule to fully utilize the shared
hardware resources.
Modern \gls{intel} processors use \gls{smt} in each physical core, but other
than parts of the cache and memory subsystem, the cores are separated and
identical.
This limits the effectiveness of symbiosis analysis.
\\

A different techniques is presented by \citeauthor{banikazemi_pam_2008}
regarding thread-to-core mappings on a \gls{cmp}-system.
In \cite{banikazemi_pam_2008} they present \emph{PAM}: a performance/power-aware
meta-scheduler, working on top of the default Linux scheduler.
While the default scheduler runs, PAM gathers information via performance
counters on cache occupancy, cycles per instruction, and the miss ratio of L1
and L2 caches for each thread.
If PAM can predict a better thread-to-core mapping, based on this information,
it overrules the default scheduler and enforces the better mapping.
With a 'Goodness' metric PAM rates the current mapping for the last
time interval.
Depending on the goodness value of the PAM mapping being better than the one of
the default scheduler, PAM continues to enforce its mapping or falls back to
default.
Goodness can be describing performance, power or energy consumption.

The experiments ran on a dual socket, quad-core machine, where two cores
share an L2 cache.
The processor does not support \gls{smt}.
Hence, the improvement gains stem not from symbiosis, but rather from
congestion awareness.
\\

Reducing cache congestion was the main point in \cite{knauerhase_using_2008}.
Like \citeauthor{banikazemi_pam_2008}, they worked on a \gls{cmp}-machine with
two separated cache groups sharing an L2 cache.
Similarly, they tried to spread memory intensive tasks as much as possible,
to reduce interference in the shared cache.
The authors introduce the metric called 'cache weight', which denotes the
\gls{llc}-cache misses per cycle for the last time interval.
Their research showed, that longer histories worsen the prediction, as thread
behaviour changes over time.
To achieve the best possible spread of all threads across cache groups,
\citeauthor{knauerhase_using_2008} balance the threads in the \gls{llc}-group
based on the aggregate cache weight.
New threads are assigned to the cache group with the lowest weight and only
cache light tasks are migrated across group boundaries.
However, to care for workload changes, an overweight thread is periodically
migrated to the lightest \gls{llc}-group.
Furthermore, cache light threads suffer next to cache intensive ones, as they
most likely start with a cold cache, each time they are scheduled.
To compensate for this, \citeauthor{knauerhase_using_2008} propose to transfer
CPU time from the cache heavy to the suffering threads.
This fairness compensation reduced the performance degradation of the most
suffering thread to less than 1\%.
\\


But \gls{cmp} and \gls{smp} systems share more resources than just the cache.
In \cite{fedorova_managing_2010}, \cite{zhuravlev_addressing_2010}, and
\cite{zhuravlev_survey_2012} \citeauthor{fedorova_managing_2010} and
\citeauthor{zhuravlev_addressing_2010} further investigate congestion on shared
resources.
Although their assumption in \cite{fedorova_managing_2010} was, that memory
reuse patterns are the indicator of
choice to predict cache interference between threads, their research lead to
the conclusion that \gls{llc}-misses are a superior predictor.
Memory reuse patterns model the access frequency of a memory area and the miss
frequency for a particular application.
This analysis has to be done off-line and assumes, that applications with high
reuse and low miss rates, do not affect other applications negatively, but
applications with low reuse and high miss rates are likely to trash the cache
of others.
To do this on-line the authors derived a metric called 'Pain', which
consists of two parts: sensitivity and intensity.
The former describes how much an application suffers from sharing caches with
others, the latter how much an application will hurt others.
The pain application A feels when scheduled with B is the product of A's
suffering and B's intensity.
Vice versa for B.
The sum of both describes the expected performance degradation for these two
applications, when being scheduled together on the same \gls{llc}.
To approximate sensitivity and intensity on-line, they assumed cache miss and
access rates would be a good measure, but it turned out only the cache miss
rate is relevant.
The memory reuse patterns focus only on the cache as shared resource.
The cache miss rate on the other hand also predicts the load on prefetching
hardware, memory controller and memory bus.
Load on these shared resources showed to be the main reason for performance
degradation in most of their benchmarks (\cite{zhuravlev_addressing_2010}).
\\

However, all research covered up to now assumed independent, non-interacting threads.
\citeauthor{hofmeyr_load_2010} present in \cite{hofmeyr_load_2010} a load
balancing technique explicitly assuming interacting, parallel applications.
They propose a technique called \emph{speed balancing} with a notion for fast
and slow cores.
They assume an oversubscribed environment, where the number of runable threads
is greater than the number of cores.
Fast and slow cores are determined by run queue length.
Thread progress is slower on longer queues, hence, slow cores are cores with a
longer run queue.
The term speed is defined as the relation of execution time per elapsed wall
clock time.
The speed of each thread determines, if it is running on a fast or a slow core.
\todo{Is speed or run queue length defining a slow core?}
The algorithm presented by \citeauthor{hofmeyr_load_2010} runs one thread per
core producing a speed measure for each thread and the core respectively.
To compare core speeds, a global average core speed is computed.
To provide equal progress opportunities, each thread needs to run on a fast
core at least once.
Hence, the balancing thread on a fast core searches for a suitable thread to
migrate from a slow core and pull it to its local core.
Thereby, the balancing thread tries to migrate the least migrated thread to
avoid constant migration of the same thread.

The parallel application model the authors assume consists of one application
spawning several worker threads, where a computation interval is followed by a
communication barrier.
Their implementation takes this application as input, executes it and provide
equal progress to each thread.
They do neither model communication between unrelated tasks in a client-server
notion, nor at arbitrary points in time.
Hence, reducing the time the slowest thread needs to reach the synchronization
point improves overall application performance.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Issues with security core idea:}
The idea to reduce attack surface for e.g. openssh cache attacks was to provide
a dedicated core for security critical applications.
This idea spawned from the assumption that L1D \& L2 cache was solely present
on a core, but the L3 cache content is a superset of all cores L1D \& L2 cache.
Hence, cache side channel attacks are still possible, although more
complicated, as the attacker not present on the core, must determine, which
cache lines correspond to the L1D \& L2 cache of the ``security core''.
Attacks presented in \cite{yarom_recovering_2014} and
\cite{bernstein_cache-timing_2005} rely on the fact, that only one application
is using cache lines on the core.
On a multicore, only observing the \gls{llc}, other running applications are
expected to disturb the observations, effectivly reducing the side channel
throughput.
\todo{This should be part of the architecture chapter, as the security core
idea wasn't presented yet.}

\paragraph{ \cite{sarma_smartbalance_2015} }
\citeauthor{sarma_smartbalance_2015} write about their approach to balance work
in a heterogeneous system.
They assume a system with a single ISA and several CPUs with different performance
characteristics and different hardware features.
\todo{check different hw features}
They introduce categories for each performance level and measure the
performance differences between each level.
This results in a matrix displaying the performance gain or degradation, when
a work package (e.g. thread) is migrated.
Their load balancing algorithm has three phases: sense, predict, balance.
During the sense phase the algorithm observes the CPU utilization for an intervall.
An intervall consists of configurable many clock ticks.
The sense-result is then used by the prediction phase to compute a load
expectation for the different performance levels.
Based on this forecast a balancing decision is made and enforced in the third
phase.
Their model can also select the best CPU size for a optimal performance per
joule ratio.

\paragraph{ \cite{zhuravlev_survey_2012} }
\citeauthor{zhuravlev_survey_2012} provide a survey over scheduling techniques,
aiming at better usage of shared resources in multicore processors.
They focus on \gls{cmp}s, which share caches between at
least two cores, but not between all cores.
Techniques like hyper-threading are also taken into account.
\todo{redo this section, cmp, smp already in terminology}
Simultaneous multiprocessors (SMPs) are not in the focus of their survey.
\gls{intel} newer architectures, e.g. Haswell, is a \gls{smp} architecture, where each
physical core has dedicated L1 \& L2 caches, but the L3 cache is shared between
all cores.
Their algorithmic focus lies on contention-aware schedulers, which consists of
four building blocks: objective, prediction, decision, and enforcement.


\paragraph{ \cite{knauerhase_using_2008} }
In \citetitle{knauerhase_using_2008} \citeauthor{knauerhase_using_2008} present
a mechanism to observe \gls{llc} misses and references, retried instructions,
core cycles, and reference cycles.
These information describe the behaviour of the threads in the system.
They assume a \gls{cmp} system and address three issues: cache interference,
migrating threads across caches and fairness between threads.

To reduce interference between cache heavy and light threads, they use the
following heuristics: cache miss per cycle, behaviour in the last time quantum,
and sum of the cache weights.
The goal is to run cache heavy threads on different \gls{llc}-groups, meaning
cores that share the same \gls{llc}.
The cache miss per cycle has shown to be a good heuristic, as it also displays
the memory access and, hence, the load on the memory bus.
Also, behavioural history longer than the last time quantum has proven
unnecessary, as the thread behaviour changes over time and longer history
clouds the prediction.
Finally, the cache weight is the sum of the weight of each thread running on
the same \gls{llc}-group.
A threads cache weight is the number of cache entries it uses. \todo{check
that}

To decide when and which threads to migrate to another \gls{llc}-group, the
thread weight and the cache load per \gls{llc}-group is computed.
New threads are assign tho the \gls{llc}-group with the smallest cache load.
To achieve better fairness between the \gls{llc}-groups, overweight threads are
migrated between groups periodically.
In general, migrations between \gls{llc}-groups are prevented, as the migrated
thread has to repopulate the cache on the new core.

To increase the fairness between cache light and cache heavy threads,
\citeauthor{knauerhase_using_2008} propose to increase the execution time of
cache light threads, as their performance suffers from running besides cache
heavy threads.
\todo{How is performance defined?}

The authors wrote a cachebuster and spinloop thread to simulate cache heave and
cache light threads. Additionally, application from the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmark
suite were used to provide further experimental prove to their claims.

definition of their experiments;
def. partially symmetric homogeneous multicores;
calculation of optimal throughput of a processor;


\paragraph{ \cite{fedorova_managing_2010} }
\textbf{assumptions:} no interaction between threads: no shared data, no
communication;

\begin{itemize}
  \item LLC miss rate of threads \textit{vs.} memory-reuse pattern
  \item more arguments for mem-reuse pattern
  \item cache sensitivit and intensity of threads --> Pain metric (off-line)
  \item cache-miss and cache-access rate
  \item on-line metric to approximate pain metric -> approx-pain
  \item approx-pain uses perfcounters to measure LLC-miss-rate, as this showed
    to be the best predictor for sensitivity and intensity
  \item LLC-miss-rate predicts contention in other shared hardware
  \item LLC-miss-rate perf counter measures prefetching miss
  \item FURTHER: Distributed Intensity Online, Power Distributed Intensity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item no interactions between threads
  \item contention focus, cooperation ignored
  \item CMP processors used; SMP architecture fundamentally different;
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Gains}
\begin{itemize}
  \item overall completion time as scheduler performance metric
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{ \cite{zhuravlev_addressing_2010} }
\begin{itemize}
  \item cache aware scheduler needs: classification scheme \& scheduling policy
  \item classification: cache light/heavy; compute light/heavy;
  \item scheduling: assignment of threads to cores based on their classification
  \item miss rate is good estimator of contention for shared ressources, as it
    counts the LLC-misses for CPU accesses and prefetching accesses. Hence, it
    measures load on FSB, DRAM ctr. and prefetching HW besides the cache
    contention.
  \item centralized sort by LLC-miss-rate per million instructions
  \item used 8core, dual socket opteron, with a cache layout similar to Haswell
  \item thread count <= core count
  \item running average miss rate for scheduling decisions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Gains}
\begin{itemize}
  \item better average performance
  \item high performance improvement for individual applications
  \item low performance variance (best/worst case) between different runs -->
    stable performance
  \item factors for performance degradations: memory controller, FSB,
    prefetching HW
  \item classification scheme evaluation
  \item 8core opteron machine is cache-layout comparable to Haswell
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item no cooperation between threads assumed (shared mem, communication)
  \item no overload situation, at much as many threads as cores in the system
\end{itemize}

\textbf{constrains} discusses load balancing in a distributed network of
machines, e.g. cluster;

\textbf{relevant} definition of static and dynamic load balancing;
five phases for dynamic load balancing: load evaluation, profitability
determination, work transfer vector calculation, task selection ,task migration


\begin{itemize}
  \item Given a collection of tasks comprising a computation and a set of
computers on which these may be executed, find a mapping of tasks to computers
that results in each computer having an approximately equal amount of work.
  \item first determine that a load imbalance exists
  \item if the cost of the imbalance exceeds the cost of load balancing then
    load balancing should be initiated
  \item work transfer vector calculation, how much work shall be transfered
  \item task selection, constrained by locality and task size, cost function to
    take this into account;
  \item task migration, state \& communication integrity must be maintained
\end{itemize}
