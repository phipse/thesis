\section{Related Work}
\label{state:related}

This section presents prior work and puts emphasis on the parts pertinent to
this work.
One restriction applies to this review: mechanism proposing changes to existing
hardware are not in the focus of this work.
This restriction excludes interesting ideas to gather behavioural information,
e.g. observation of cache coherency traffic proposed in
\cite{cruz_dynamic_2014}.

\paragraph{ \cite{sarma_smartbalance_2015} }
\citeauthor{sarma_smartbalance_2015} write about their approach to balance work
in a heterogeneous system.
They assume a system with a single ISA and several CPUs with different performance
characteristics and different hardware features.
\todo{check different hw features}
They introduce categories for each performance level and measure the
performance differences between each level.
This results in a matrix displaying the performance gain or degradation, when
a work package (e.g. thread) is migrated.
Their load balancing algorithm has three phases: sense, predict, balance.
During the sense phase the algorithm observes the CPU utilization for an intervall.
An intervall consists of configurable many clock ticks.
The sense-result is then used by the prediction phase to compute a load
expectation for the different performance levels.
Based on this forecast a balancing decision is made and enforced in the third
phase.
Their model can also select the best CPU size for a optimal performance per
joule ratio.

\paragraph{ \cite{zhuravlev_survey_2012} }
\citeauthor{zhuravlev_survey_2012} provide a survey over scheduling techniques,
aiming at better usage of shared resources in multicore processors.
They focus on \gls{cmp}s, which share caches between at
least two cores, but not between all cores.
Techniques like hyper-threading are also taken into account.
\todo{redo this section, cmp, smp already in terminology}
Simultaneous multiprocessors (SMPs) are not in the focus of their survey.
\gls{intel} newer architectures, e.g. Haswell, is a \gls{smp} architecture, where each
physical core has dedicated L1 \& L2 caches, but the L3 cache is shared between
all cores.
Their algorithmic focus lies on contention-aware schedulers, which consists of
four building blocks: objective, prediction, decision, and enforcement.


\paragraph{ \cite{knauerhase_using_2008} }
In \citetitle{knauerhase_using_2008} \citeauthor{knauerhase_using_2008} present
a mechanism to observe \gls{llc} misses and references, retried instructions,
core cycles, and reference cycles.
These information describe the behaviour of the threads in the system.
They assume a \gls{cmp} system and address three issues: cache interference,
migrating threads across caches and fairness between threads.

To reduce interference between cache heavy and light threads, they use the
following heuristics: cache miss per cycle, behaviour in the last time quantum,
and sum of the cache weights.
The goal is to run cache heavy threads on different \gls{llc}-groups, meaning
cores that share the same \gls{llc}.
The cache miss per cycle has shown to be a good heuristic, as it also displays
the memory access and hence the load on the memory bus.
Also, behavioural history longer than the last time quantum has proven
unnecessary, as the thread behaviour changes over time and longer history
clouds the prediction.
Finally, the cache weight is the sum of the weight of each thread running on
the same \gls{llc}-group.
A threads cache weight is the number of cache entries it uses. \todo{check
that}

To decide when and which threads to migrate to another \gls{llc}-group, the
thread weight and the cache load per \gls{llc}-group is computed.
New threads are assign tho the \gls{llc}-group with the smallest cache load.
To achieve better fairness between the \gls{llc}-groups, overweight threads are
migrated between groups periodically.
In general, migrations between \gls{llc}-groups are prevented, as the migrated
thread has to repopulate the cache on the new core.

To increase the fairness between cache light and cache heavy threads,
\citeauthor{knauerhase_using_2008} propose to increase the execution time of
cache light threads, as their performance suffers from running besides cache
heavy threads.
\todo{How is performance defined?}

The authors wrote a cachebuster and spinloop thread to simulate cache heave and
cache light threads. Additionally, application from the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmark
suite were used to provide further experimental prove to their claims.

\paragraph{ \cite{fedorova_managing_2010} }
\textbf{assumptions:} no interaction between threads: no shared data, no
communication;

\begin{itemize}
  \item LLC miss rate of threads \textit{vs.} memory-reuse pattern
  \item more arguments for mem-reuse pattern
  \item cache sensitivit and intensity of threads --> Pain metric (offline)
  \item cache-miss and cache-access rate
  \item online metric to approximate pain metric -> approx-pain
  \item approx-pain uses perfcounters to measure LLC-miss-rate, as this showed
    to be the best predictor for sensitivity and intensity
  \item LLC-miss-rate predicts contention in other shared hardware
  \item LLC-miss-rate perf counter measures prefetching miss
  \item FURTHER: Distributed Intensity Online, Power Distributed Intensity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item no interactions between threads
  \item contention focus, cooperation ignored
  \item CMP processors used; SMP architecture fundamentally different;
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Gains}
\begin{itemize}
  \item overall completion time as scheduler performance metric
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{ \cite{zhuravlev_addressing_2010} }
\begin{itemize}
  \item cache aware scheduler needs: classification scheme \& scheduling policy
  \item classification: cache light/heavy; compute light/heavy;
  \item scheduling: assignment of threads to cores based on their classification
  \item miss rate is good estimator of contention for shared ressources, as it
    counts the LLC-misses for CPU accesses and prefetching accesses. Hence, it
    measures load on FSB, DRAM ctr. and prefetching HW besides the cache
    contention.
  \item centralized sort by LLC-miss-rate per million instructions
  \item used 8core, dual socket opteron, with a cache layout similar to Haswell
  \item thread count <= core count
  \item running average miss rate for scheduling decisions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Gains}
\begin{itemize}
  \item better average performance
  \item high performance improvement for individual applications
  \item low performance variance (best/worst case) between different runs -->
    stable performance
  \item factors for performance degradations: memory controller, FSB,
    prefetching HW
  \item classification scheme evaluation
  \item 8core opteron machine is cache-layout comparable to Haswell
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item no cooperation between threads assumed (shared mem, communication)
  \item no overload situation, at much as many threads as cores in the system
\end{itemize}

    done before.
