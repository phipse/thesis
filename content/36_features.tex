* First goal: Distribute several threads to different cores
* L4Re integration
* HyperThread awareness

\paragraph{Issues with security core idea:}
The idea to reduce attack surface for e.g. openssh cache attacks was to provide
a dedicated core for security critical applications.
This idea spawned from the assumption that L1D \& L2 cache was solely present
on a core, but the L3 cache content is a superset of all cores L1D \& L2 cache.
Hence, cache side channel attacks are still possible, although more
complicated, as the attacker not present on the core, must determine, which
cache lines correspond to the L1D \& L2 cache of the ``security core''.
Attacks presented in \cite{yarom_recovering_2014} and
\cite{bernstein_cache-timing_2005} rely on the fact, that only one application
is using cache lines on the core.
On a multicore, only observing the \gls{llc}, other running applications are
expected to disturb the observations, effectivly reducing the side channel
throughput.
