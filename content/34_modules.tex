\subsection{Hardware performance monitoring}

* Thread description as central data storage

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Analyse}
  \paragraph{Hardware}
    * Use dedicated hardware --> hardware analysis future work \\
    * Haswell: per core: L1 \& L2 cache; shared L3 cache between all cores

  \paragraph{Measurement}
    * Measure the load on each core during a time interval \textbf{TI}; \\
    * measure LLC misses during last \textbf{TI};


% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Predict}

  * Predict load and LLC misses of each thread for the next time intervall; \\


% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Decide}

  * Decide on a thread distribution to cores, based on predictions;

  \subsubsection{Placement Generator}

  \paragraph{Pseudo-code of placement algorithm}
  \begin{verbatim}
  from all threads:
    select #core highest LLC miss rate
    select #core highest exec-time
    intersection of both are critical threads
    if threads placed on different cores
      then do nothing
    else
      move higher LLC miss rate thread to other core
    do accounting

  forall threads left do:
    bin by priority levels
    sort each bin by miss rate

  forall prio-bin in prio-bin-list do:
    while threads in prio-bin
      dequeue highest miss rate
      sort cores by lowest accounted miss rate
      place max(#core, #threads left in bin) threads RR on cores;
  \end{verbatim}

  \paragraph{\gls{smt} abstraction code}
  \begin{verbatim}
  if SMT is enabled
    sort threads once by exec time and once by LLC miss
    while duplication:
      look at next LLC-miss thread and dequeue it from exec-time
      look at next exec-miss thread and dequeue it from LLC-miss

    while threads unassigned && queue not empty:
      dequeue one thread from LLC miss list for SMT#0
      dequeue one thread from LLC-miss list for SMT#1
      dequeue one thread from exe-time list for SMT#0
      dequeue one thread form exec-time list for SMT#1
  \end{verbatim}

  \paragraph{Minimize migration pseudo-code}
  \begin{verbatim}
  sort all threads by LLC-miss
  sliding window size #threads with less than 5% LLC miss difference
  if at least 2 threads in the current window are migrated
    if two threads are swaping cores
      don't do the migration
    ALTERNATIVELY
    if the from-core-to-core-matrix has entries on opposing fields
      swap the to-values of both entries
  \end{verbatim}

\subsection{Enforce}

  * Enforce the thread-to-core assignment
