The first last placement and group placement algorithms are used in the
placement generator.
The balancing need algorithm is used in the decision component to see if the
current performance values bring the system out of balance.
SMT distribution algorithms are part of the core accounting, as the SMT
abstraction is implemented there.
The ready queue balancing serves as baseline to show the benefit of behaviour
analysis.

The simple balanced ready queue assignment to cores is used to rate the
performance of the behaviour aware scheduling.
It ignores configurations and just places an incoming thread on the core with
the least threads.
As threads leave the system the ready queues shrink differently, which is
compensated by entering threads.

To prove that behaviour analysis brings any benefit, it has to clearly beat
this simple algorithm.
