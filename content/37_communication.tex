\section{Communication}
\label{design:comm}

\paragraph{Comm types}
distributed computation with comm synchronization
client-server communication with single threaded server and single threaded
client or multithreaded client.
multi thread clients need to be distributed like distr. computations
one client is scheduled to server thread.

Observation possibilities, quantity, partners, kernel and userland. 

\paragraph{Kernel}
\paragraph{Matrix}
sparse matrix, symmetric, thread to thread communication increases counter
\paragraph{Map}
thread local storage of <capability, counter> map, counting each \gls{ipc}

\paragraph{User land}
\paragraph{static configuration parameter}
communication group and type property via task specific configuration
distr \& clsvr;
\paragraph{Comm partner cap}
scheduler interface addition to cooperate with the thread and let him tell the
threadMapper the threads it talks to, by providing a cap on the thread.
TM can check, if object is known -- caps point to same object syscall -- and
build groups and schedule them accordingly. 


\paragraph{Implementation}
Ned script with task specific configuration if communication attributes are
necessary.
