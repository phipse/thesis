\section{Assumptions and Goals}
\label{design:assump}

The research presented in \ref{state:related} and the constraints due to
the microkernel environment mentioned in \ref{state:env} lead to the following
assumptions:

\begin{description}
  \item[Thread groups]
  \item[Performance]
  \item[Energy efficency] In case of overload equal to performance algorithm
\end{description}
