\section{Assumptions and Goals}
\label{design:assump}

The research presented in \ref{state:related} and the constraints due to
the microkernel environment mentioned in \ref{state:env} lead to the following
assumptions:

\begin{description}
  \item[interacting threads]
  \item[Thread groups]
  \item[security core concept] think someone about real time
  \item[thread priority levels]
  \item[priority guarantees] accross core boundaries at placement time?
    options: one prio bin on one core; RR on all cores by prio bin; high prio
    first, place depending on LLC miss rate || exec time accounting?
  \item[]
  \item[partially symmetric multicore processor]
  \item[fixed architecture] Haswell with HT en-/disabled
  \item[Performance] thread placement algorithm using hardware topology and
    thread behaviour information
  \item[Energy efficency] In case of overload equal to performance algorithm,
    otherwise, race to idle, typical: race to idle is best
\end{description}
