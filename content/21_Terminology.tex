  \item[\gls{ht}] \gls{ht} is a technique used by \gls{intel}, which provides
    two logical hardware threads on one physical core.
    The idea behind this technique is to improve the utilization of the
    hardware resources, by multiplexing two threads.
    However, the performance improvements are around 10\% compared to disabled
    \gls{ht}.
