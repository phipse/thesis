\todo{Item sorting}

\begin{description}
  \item[\Gls{utcb}] A \gls{utcb} is user-level memory containing information
    about a thread and communication registers and buffers.
    \todo{UTCB description}

  \item[\Gls{sc}] A \gls{sc} contains information for the scheduler consisting
    of a priority level, execution time, remaining execution time.
    \todo{What other items are in a scheduling context}

  \item[Thread] A thread is a unit of execution, consisting of a \gls{utcb}
    and a \gls{sc}.

  \item[Task] A task consists of a one or more threads and provides memory and
    memory management for its threads.

  \item[\Gls{ipc}] \Gls{ipc} is the only way for threads in L4Re/Fiasco.OC
    to communicate with one another.
    It is synchronous communication with the following modes of operation:
    send, open wait, closed wait, reply \& open wait, call.
    A thread initiating an open wait, waits for an arbitrary thread to contact
    him, whereas a closed wait, expects a specific thread.
    A call is normally used for communication with a service, where a reply is
    awaited, hence it is a
    \todo{atomic?}
    combination of a send with a closed wait.
    To initiate an \gls{ipc} in L4Re/Fiasco.OC the sending thread needs to hold
    a capability on the receiving thread.


  \item[Core] To a physical CPU core is referred to as core.

  \item[Cache] Generally, a cache is used to store frequently accessed data.
    Depending on the type of cache different evocation policies can be applied,
    like \gls{fifo} or \gls{lru}.
    The hardware cache present on a CPU uses \gls{lru}.
    A cache can have several levels, creating a cache hierarchy.
    If data is evicted in a lower hierarchy level, it moves to a higher level.
    If there is no higher level, the data is written back to memory.
    \todo{Write-through and write-back cache?}

  \item[Migration] The process of moving on thread from one core
    to another core is called migration.
    The cores do not necessarily need to be on the same chip, nor do they need
    to be in the same machine.

  \item[\Gls{ht}] Hyper-threading a technique used by \gls{intel}, which provides
    two hardware threads on one physical core.
    The idea behind this technique is to improve the utilization of the
    hardware resources, by multiplexing two threads.
    \todo{However, the performance improvements are around 10\% compared to disabled
      hyper-threading.}
    To a \Gls{ht} is referred to as a logical core.

  \item[\Gls{cmp}] \gls{cmp} is a category of processor architectures, where
    the CPU consists of two equal CPU chips soldered together on one die.
    As a result the \gls{llc} is not shared among all cores.
    Consider a quad-core CPU build out of two dual-core CPUs.
    Hence, cores 0 \& 1 share their \gls{llc} and cores 2 \& 3, respectively.

  \item[\Gls{smp}] \gls{smp} is a category of processor architectures, where
    all cores are equal and the \gls{llc} is shared among all of them.

  \item[Epoch] Describes a pre-defined number of clock ticks.
