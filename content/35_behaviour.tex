\section{Behaviour Observation}
\label{design:behaviour}

The key element of this project is behaviour observation.
The threads behaviour is displayed through its resource usage.
Cache misses and instructions show how memory and computation intense a thread
is.

To acquire these information, the kernel needs to run performance counter on
each core and provide per thread accounting.
Via a system call interface the account values can be requested and reseted for
each thread.

As shown in \cite{zhuravlev_addressing_2010} and \cite{knauerhase_using_2008}
\gls{llc} misses are a good indicate for the memory usage of a thread.
A high \gls{llc} miss value indicates the thread is using a lot of memory and
due to the misses it waits often for the memory request to be served.
During this waiting phases, the thread cannot proceed, hence the executed
instruction count is low.

So it is expected that a memory intensive thread differs in \gls{llc} misses
and instructions per cycle from a computation intense thread.
